# NodeJs Live Coding

## Getting started

Let's imagine you got the new project where you need to find all critical parts that can broke application.
The main goal it's improve the code with any knowing patterns, tools, approaches that you know.
Feel free to highlight any things that look suspicious from your perspective.
Feel free to use any tools, documentation and even Google. The main goal it's to achieve the goal with any knowing approaches.

## Requirements

- Web application should follow RESTFul design as interface for client
- Application should be reliable (Reduce the chance of errors appearing)
- Application should be scalable (New features should be added without or with minimal changes in the existing code)
- Application should be readable (Each part of code should be understandable with minimal explanation)
- Application should follow all best practice, no matter is it related to production code or developer experience (how comfortable to collaborate on the project with other developers)
